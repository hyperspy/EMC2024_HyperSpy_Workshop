## Software installation

To use the Jupyter Notebooks in this repository, you need to install some software packages first. It installation instructions for beginners and advanced users can be found below.


### Simple installation instructions (best for Python beginners)

The easiest way to install all the software required to run the Jupyter Notebooks in this repository is to [install the HyperSpy Bundle](https://hyperspy.org/hyperspy-bundle/install.html) that you can download from [here](https://github.com/hyperspy/hyperspy-bundle/releases/latest).


### Advanced installation instructions (for advanced users)

If you prefer to customize your installation, we suggest installing a conda distribution (we suggest [MiniForge](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge)) and install all the required Python packages in a dedicated environment executing the following commands in a terminal (the conda prompt in Windows):


```bash
conda install nb_conda_kernels jupyterlab start_jupyter_cm ipympl -c conda-forge
conda create -n hyperspy_EMC2024 python=3.11 hyperspy pyxem ipympl exspy lumispy ipykernel -c conda-forge
```

To add Jupyter to the context menu of your file browser execute the following command:

```bash
start_jupyter_cm
```

To use HyperSpy in JupyterLab, start Jupyter Lab and choose the `Python [conda env:hyperspy_EMC2024]` kernel. Alternatively, start JupyterLab from the `hyperspy_EMC2024` environment as follows:

```bash
conda activate hyperspy_EMC2024
jupyter lab
```
